# Blender Extension Test

A set of [Blender](https://blender.org) [extensions](https://extensions.blender.org)
put together for testing how to develop and how to deploy them.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

TBD, but the idea is to use this repo's GitHub Pages site as static extension registry for Blender.

## üîß Building and Running

TBD, but basically install the **Blender Development** VSCode extension by Jacques Lucke extension,
then call `Blender: Start` and `Blender: Reload Extensions`.

### üî® Build the Project

Install the `fake-bpy-module` package to allow local code compilation and code completion.

```shell
pip install fake-bpy-module
```

### ‚ñ∂ Running and Settings

TBD

## ü§ù Collaborate with My Project
